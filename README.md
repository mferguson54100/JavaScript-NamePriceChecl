# misra-js-starter

A good starting point for any JS work done by students in my JS courses.

This is obviously a very opinionated starter repo for JS projects.

Its intent is to introduce students to some commonly used tools for professional JS development within VS Code.

It includes some VS Code extensions and linting with Airbnb style guide and Stylelint for CSS linting.

_See 'fonts' folder to install some nice fonts that should work well._
